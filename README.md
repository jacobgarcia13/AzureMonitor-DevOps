# AzureMonitor-DevOps

Sample Azure Monitoring Environment For SQL at Scale Using Azure DevOps and Azure Policy 

## Overview Of Architecture

![Architecture](https://github.com/jacobgarcia13/AzureMonitor-DevOps/blob/main/Images/Monitoring_POC_Architecture1.png?raw=true)

## Replicating the Architecture 

1. Create Management Groups hiearchy to mirror above architecture

2. Create Log Analytics Workspace in Resource Group dedicated to monitoring

3. Set Azure Policy to enforce collection of diagnostic logs (in this case for SQL resources) at Management group level

4. Leverage Azure DevOps for Alerts, Policy (optional), and Workbooks (optional) or other visualizations) as code

5. Create Action Group(s) in Resource Group dedicated to monitoring either using ARM templates or Manually

## Routing Alerts by Tags in a Logic App
A Logic App can be built to respond to alerts from a central Log Analytics workspace. One approach is to leverage tags to determine alert routing. [Managed Identity can be enabled in Logic Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/create-managed-service-identity) to support triggers and actions like Graph API calls to fetch tag information. Please note that a system-assigned role as management group reader would be necessary to provide tag visiblity across a central workspace.

In the example above, tags are encoded with email metadata. The Logic App will parse this information and then send an Outlook email to a designated address contained within the tag. Outlook is one of many [Logic Apps connectors](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/connector-reference/connector-reference-logicapps-connectors) that can be configured to simplify actions and triggers. Additional and/or alternative connectors could be put into place to support steering alerts to the right place.
