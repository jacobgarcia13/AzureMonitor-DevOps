## Overview Of Architecture

![Architecture](https://github.com/jacobgarcia13/AzureMonitor-DevOps/blob/main/Images/Monitoring_POC_Architecture1.png?raw=true)

## Replicating the Architecture 

1. Create Management Groups hiearchy to mirror above architecture

2. Create Log Analytics Workspace in Resource Group dedicated to monitoring

3. Set Azure Policy to enforce collection of diagnostic logs (in this case for SQL resources) at Management group level

4. Leverage Azure DevOps for Alerts, Policy (optional), and Workbooks (optional) or other visualizations) as code

5. Create Action Group(s) in Resource Group dedicated to monitoring either using ARM templates or Manually
